Successfully pushed local directory files for school planner to github repository.

Definitely tricky for me at first but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

Anyone with suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Let me know if pushed files are working properly for you in Visual Studio.

***Some of the source code for the planner probably will need to be re-written. The source code references old directory
locations for checkboxlist controls and so on, although pushed files do include those referenced notepad documents themselves. 
This might be a cool place to start. I would also like advice for making
this program as portable as possible, including how to get around referencing local directories for control values that 
would not translate to other user machines.
