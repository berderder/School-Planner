# School-Planner
Simple School Planner I built utilizing Visual Basic and Visual Studio

Hello everyone,

This is my first time using GitHUb or any sort of open source sharing.

This repository contains a simple school planner I built utilizing Visual Basic and Visual Studio.

I needed something to keep track of assignment and discussion progress for school, and as they say, necessity is the mother of invention.

I hope I am uploading this correctly. I already have some trouble dealing with the various files involved with Studio, but I will try my best and am open to any comments or advice if my upload doesn't seem to work.

I am just putting this out there publicly for fun.  If anyone would like to make any changes whatsoever, I am open. I just want to get started with GitHub and explore what it's like on here.

Again, this is Visual Basic utilizing the most recent version of Microsoft Studio.

Thanks!
